  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    My name is Chavez Poon, I am a freelance website designer and developer based in Hong Kong SAR. 
    
    I was born, raised and educated in Hong Kong, where I earned my Diploma of Vocational Education in Information Technology in December 2023.
    
    I am familiar with HTML, CSS, WordPress, WooCommerce and Shopify with over 5+ years of experience.
    
    Over the course of my career, I have worked as a Social Media Manager and Website Administrator at an NGO Organization.
    
    Aside from being a website designer and developer, I'm also a founder and owner of a online clothing brand.
    
    I believe the process of creating some intresting and amazing stuffs from nothing is deeply rewarding and seeing your work come together and materialize on a computer screen is a feeling like no other.
    
    Aside from technological, I am a devoted Roman Catholic for more than 10 years, and I love playing musics (Pipe Organ, Piano and Drum sets), hiking and being active in outdoor. I alsohave a keen interest in history and personal development.
